# Ng Color Picker lib and demo

A color picker as QColorDialog in Qt, works the same except the 'Pick Screen Color' is missing, because this function is limitated in browser.
- The implementation refers to QColorDialog in https://code.woboq.org/qt5/qtbase/src/widgets/dialogs/qcolordialog.cpp.html
- `hsv2rgb` and `rgb2hsv` refers to QColor in https://code.woboq.org/qt5/qtbase/src/gui/painting/qcolor.cpp.html
